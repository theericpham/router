      Look up next-hop IP address in routing table using destination IP address
        if no next-hop IP, send ICMP type 3 code 0, destination network unreachable
      Look up MAC address for next-hop IP in ARP cache
      If next-hop MAC isn't cached,
        send ARP request for it
        add this packet to queue

    if ARP reply
      insert IP to MAC address mapping into cache (returns an ARP request if one exists)
      for all packets waiting on this ARP request
        update packet fields by casting as ethernet header
        set ethernet frame

        change code from ARP request to ARP reply
      set ethernet frame

      return packet

    for each request in cache
      handle ARP request

sr_icmp.c --> new file
  sr_send_icmp(sr_instance* sr, uint8_t type, uint8_t code, uint32_t dip, uint8_t* payload, char* interface)
    NOTE: why are there 2 structs for icmp and which one do we use?
